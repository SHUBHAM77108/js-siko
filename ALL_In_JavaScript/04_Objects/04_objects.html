    // Object make our code more organied instead of creating a bunch of variables for the products values like the name and the price and other details we can just group all these related values together into one objects.
    // object also allow us to use multiple values instead of console. logging each of these values individually we can just console log the whole object and dispaly all the values at once

    // this way we can create a object the in this object name: and price: is called property using the property we can access specifice values 
    // name: 'Socks', this is called the Property-value pair we can have many property value pairs in an object and we separate them with a comma
    // product.name this syntax is called Dot Notation

    const product = {
        name: 'Socks',
        price: 1090
    };
    console.log(product); // this way we can call the object 
    console.log(product.name); // this way we can access the specifice values from object

    // we can also use the property to change a value inside an object 
    product.name = 'Cotton socks'; // this way we can change the value an object

    product.newProperty = true; // using the syntax we can also add value to an object
    console.log(product)

    delete product.newProperty; //using this way we can also remove a value from an object
    console.log(product);
