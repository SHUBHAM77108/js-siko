    // Object make our code more organied instead of creating a bunch of variables for the products values like the name and the price and other details we can just group all these related values together into one objects.
    // object also allow us to use multiple values instead of console. logging each of these values individually we can just console log the whole object and dispaly all the values at once

    // this way we can create a object the in this object name: and price: is called property using the property we can access specifice values 
    // name: 'Socks', this is called the Property-value pair we can have many property value pairs in an object and we separate them with a comma
    // product.name this syntax is called Dot Notation

    const product = {
        name: 'Socks',
        price: 1090
    };
    console.log(product); // this way we can call the object 
    console.log(product.name); // this way we can access the specifice values from object

    // we can also use the property to change a value inside an object 
    product.name = 'Cotton socks'; // this way we can change the value an object

    product.newProperty = true; // using the syntax we can also add value to an object
    console.log(product)

    delete product.newProperty; //using this way we can also remove a value from an object
    console.log(product);

    //***** access the object values 
    const product2 = {
        name: 'shirt',
        ['delivery-time']: '1 day',
        rating: { // this is nested object
            stars: 4.5,
            count: 87
        },
        // function is also a value in JS and we can save them in an object to access
        // function inside object this is called a method 
        // we've actually been using method whole time console.log is actually a method and console is an object provided by JS
        // e.g Math.random() is also method and Math is an object aur random is an a function
        // object + function = Method
        fun: function function1() {
            console.log('function inside object');
        }
    }
    console.log(product2);
    console.log(product2.name); // Dot Notation
    console.log(product2['name']); // we can also access the value from object property using this way is called bracket Notation
    console.log(product2.delivery-time); // if we access the property that ways it will be throw an a error because JS will be think we are doing Math
    console.log(product2['delivery-time']); // using bracket Notation we can also access the property this way delivery-time 

    console.log(product2.rating.count);// this way we can access values in the nested Object
   
   product2.fun(); // this way we call a function inside in any objects

   // ***** Built-in Objects 
   // console.log() and Math.random() is an a built-in objects
   //2 More Built-in Objects JSON and localStorage

   // JSON Built-in Object - help us works with JSON
   // JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - is an a syntax is similar to JavaScript object but has less features
   // JSON does not support "" and function 
   // way we learn JSON a JavaScript is only makes sense in JS But JSON can be understood by almost every programming language so JSON syntax is more universal 
   // we use JSON when we send data between two computer that might use different programming Lg

   // ***** Use JSCON
   console.log(JSON.stringify(product2));// so stringify is a method of the JSON object so it's a function that is saved inside this object and we can call this function using () bracket 
   // between the bracket we can give it a JavaScript objects we want to convert in JSON

   // stringify is that it actually results in a string

   // converting JSON string back into an JS Object
   const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
   console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString)); // back into JS object

    // *** Next Built-in object: localStorage
    // -Save values more permanently so far we've been saving our values in variables
    // however variable are saving values temporary they only exist on the current page if we refresh the page or close the page all the variable are deleted 

    // localStorage is only supports 'string'
