        // This is function
        function greeting(){
            console.log('hello');
        }
        greeting(); // this is called the Call Function and (running function)

        // Function are also values we can save inside a variable like number,string and boolean values;

        const function1 = function greeting(){
            console.log('hello');
        };

        console.log(function1); // return hole function
        console.log(typeof function1); // function
        function1(); // we can call function this wall by using variable name and this will be excute ha function // hello

        // In upper function we use the variable name to call the function not using the function name (greeting) to call
        // that way we not use of function name than we can remove them 

        const function2 = function() {
            console.log('hello');
        } // this called Anonymous Function which means a function wihout a name 

//*** advantages of simple function creating is we  one it's easier to read and number two it gives us a feature called hoisting which means we can call this function greeting brackets before we create

        // using hoisting we don't have to worry about what order we write this code

        // hoisting doesn't work when we create our function and save it in a variable

        const object1 = {
            num: 2,
            // we don't need to give function name because we use call function using method name 
            // Anonymous Function
            // fun: function greeting() {
            fun: function() {
                console.log('hello3');
            }
        };
        object1.fun(); // we can call function save inside objects method.

        function display(param) {
            console.log(param);
        }

        display(2); // this way we can also pass a function into a function

        function run(param) {
            // we can use param just like variable and because param contains function we can actually call it 
            param(); // hello4 // this called (passing a function into another function)
        }

        // So this take function and save into param
        run(function() {
            console.log('hello4');
        })
        //the function we're passing inside run we're are called a (callback function) or a (callback)

//*** so setTimeout is build in function in JS
        // now setTimeout is take two parameters:
        // 1) A function we want to run in the future
        // 2) How long to wait before running this function (take a number in millisecond) 1000 millisecond = 1 second;
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('timeout');
            console.log('timeout2');// that we normally write will be synchronous code line by line
        }, 3000);// so setTimeout will wait for 3 sec
        //so that is setTimeout we give it a function and it will call this function after a certain amount of time

        //*** so now we're going to learn called Asynchronous code
        console.log('next line');//this will run first before setTimeout function this called asynchronous code

        //asynchronous code:
        // means won't wait for a line to finish before going to the next line (as usual the only time that code becomes asynchronous is when we use certain feature of JS like setTimeout)

        // synchronous code:
        // means will wait for one line to finish before going to the next line // so all the code we're written in this JS learning so far has been synchronous code (code run line by line)

        // so setTimeout is only part that is asynchronous now the advantages of set timeout being asynchronous is that it doesn't block our code for 3 second waiting for this timer to finish


//****so setTimeout is build in function in JS
        // now setTimeout is take two parameters:
        // 1) A function we want to run in the future

        setInterval(function() {
            console.log('interval');
        }, 3000);// setInterval will run this function every 3 sec
        // setInterval is also asynchronous

        console.log('next line 2')
